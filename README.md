# About IDbot
IDbot is a group project part of the 3rd year Design, Make and Test (ME3-DMT) group project at Imperial College London. The DMT project is a realistic engineering project with rigorous time and budget constraint that spans throughout the academic year. A brief description of the inspiration and some features on this project can be found in the project proposal document [here](https://github.com/limbryan/IDbot/blob/master/DMT%20Proposal-IDbot.pdf).

A video demo of the project prototype can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWTzkd-DQiQ)
